description: "Under the Greenwood Tree: A Rural Painting of the Dutch School is a\
  \ novel by Thomas Hardy, published anonymously in 1872. It was Hardy's second published\
  \ novel, the last to be printed without his name, and the first of his great series\
  \ of Wessex novels. Whilst Hardy originally thought of simply calling it The Mellstock\
  \ Quire, he settled on a title taken from a song in Shakespeare's As You Like It\
  \ (Act II, Scene V).\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
